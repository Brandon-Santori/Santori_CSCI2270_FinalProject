# Santori_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Brandon Santori Final Project

This is a board game, the goal is to reach the end of the board game before the bots which you are competing against.  

There will be shortcuts and power-ups which can help the player or bot gain an advantage and enable them to win.

There will be a menu to select either roll dice, use powerup, or quit.
